<h2>Wayne Rooney posts head injury picture after England criticism</h2>
<p>Rooney suffered the cut via the boot of Manchester United team-mate Phil Jones, forcing him out of England's World Cup qualifiers on Friday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said:  "Some people seem to be questioning my commitment and the fact I had to pull out of the two games.</p>
<p>"I'm sure people will see the reason why I won't be able to play."</p>
<p>Rooney, 27, added: "There's nothing I would like more than to be helping the lads in the qualifiers."</p>
<p>United boss David Moyes said the forward could be out for three weeks following the accident, which happened on Saturday in the build-up to United's defeat by Liverpool - a game Rooney missed because of the injury.</p>
<p>England team-mate Theo Walcott has described the photograph as "like something out of a horror film".</p>
<p>Roy Hodgson's side face Moldova at Wembley on Friday and then a trip to Ukraine on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rooney is one of three players who have withdrawn from the squad because of injury.</p>
<p>Glen Johnson was forced off with an ankle injury during Liverpool's victory at Anfield on Sunday, while United's Jones was also substituted with a similar problem.</p>
