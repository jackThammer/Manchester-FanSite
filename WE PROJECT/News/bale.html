<p>Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has revealed that the club's pursuit of Gareth Bale was hastened byManchester United's interest in the Welshman.</p>
<p>As revealed by Goal, the reigning Premier League champions made a bid of £125 million for the 24-year-old, though Tottenham were adamant they would not sell to a divisional rival.</p>
<p>United's move for Bale sparked los Blancos into action and, according to Perez, it was the two-time PFA Player of the Year's desire to fulfil a “childhood dream” that secured the deal.</p>
<p>“Tottenham initially did not want to sell, but when we heard Manchester United made an offer, we tabled a bid ourselves,” the Madrid president told Cadena SER.</p>
<p>“His childhood dream to play for Madrid eventually proved to be decisive.”</p>
<p>Bale moved to the Santiago Bernabeu for a world-record £86 million and Perez has defended the fee, insisting that last season's La Liga runners-up did not pay over the odds for the Welshman.</p>
<p>“Bale came to Madrid relatively cheap,” the Blancos chief continued.</p>
<p>“Signing the best players out there is Madrid's philosophy and Bale was the best available player this summer. We had been following him for two years.”</p>
<p>The 24-year-old scored on his official Madrid debut against Villarreal, but missed this weekend's win over Getafe due to a thigh problem, though should be match fit in time for the upcoming derby against Atletico Madrid.</p>
