<h2>Manchester United signed Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini for £27.5m late on transfer deadline day.</h2>
<p>United had made a joint bid of £28m for both Fellaini, 25, and full-back Leighton Baines in August, which the Toffees had described as "derisory".
Fellaini had a release clause of £23.5m in his Everton deal until 31 July.</p>
<h2>“Being a Manchester United player is something every player dreams of”</h2>
<p>United also tried to sign Real Madrid left-back Fabio Coentrao on loan,but it was confirmed on Tuesday that the deal fell through.</p>
<p>On Fellaini's signing, manager David Moyes said: "He is a player with great ability and strength and I think he will make a real difference to our squad.
"He can play higher up, if we need it, behind the striker or as a defensive or holding midfielder. In any position in the middle of the field he's comfortable.
"Because of that I think it's definitely a position where people have said we've been short of numbers, with the likes of Paul Scholes [retiring] and Darren Fletcher not ready to come back just now. I felt we needed to strengthen there and I'm glad we got him."
</p>
<p>The Belgian, who joined Everton from Standard Liege for £15m in 2008, was contracted to the Toffees until 2016.</p>
<p>He said: "I am thrilled to sign for Manchester United. I have known the manager for many years now and I have a lot of respect for his way of working. When I was given the opportunity to work with him again, I jumped at the chance.</p>
