<p>The German international’s registration was reportedly offered toManchester United on 7th August 2013, but neither the player or his father were part of nor aware of that.
Ozil senior was reported by the Kolner Express as saying: “Some flimsy people have done, what I never would have considered possible.</p>
<p>“Someone tried to contact Manchester United and pretended to be me. This is not a trivial offence. We will get to the bottom of this now.”</p>
<p>While Mustafa Ozil declined to name names, his insistence that he’ll sue suggests that he is aware of who is responsible for the offence.</p>
<p>Ozil would go on to sign for United's Premier League rivals Arsenal on deadline day in a club record deal.</p>
