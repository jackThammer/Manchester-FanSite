<p><font color="white">Manchester United will play in a new away kit this season boasting the iconic gingham check from the city's industrial heritage.
The new away shirt, unveiled during the club's pre-season tour in Japan at Osaka Castle, features the gingham used on last season's home shirt with a bigger, bolder design.</font></p>
<p><font color="white">The shirt's large black and midnight navy gingham checks represent Manchester's proud industrial past when the check was produced in the city's booming cotton mills in the 18th century.</font></p>
<p><font color="white">The collar is a black round neck and on the back of shirt, on the neck, is a white woven devil from the United club crest. The club crest at the heart of the jersey is an embroidered monochromatic midnight navy and white. The new away shorts are midnight navy with a thin navy blue stripe on the hem at the back while the new away socks are navy blue with a white stripe between two black stripes, with the traditional United bar design.</font></p>
<p><font color="white">The new kit showcases Nike's commitment to aiding the performance of players with key technological benefits:
Recycled Polyester</font></p>

<p><font color="white">The kit is made from recycled polyester as part of Nike's commitment to produce performance apparel with reduced environmental impact. The shirt and shorts of each kit are made from up to thirteen recycled plastic water bottles.</font></p>
<p><font color="white">In the pioneering process, plastic bottles are chopped into flakes, then melted down to form yarn that is spun into fabric, reducing energy consumption by up to 30 percent compared to manufacturing virgin polyester.</font></p>
<p><font color="white">Since 2010, Nike has diverted more than 1.1 billion plastic bottles from landfill through the use of recycled polyester.</font></p>
